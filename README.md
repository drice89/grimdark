# Grimdark

### The story so far...

The year is 42222 - Your ship exits warp space and you hear the blaring of sirens as you are thown from your feet by the jarring of your spacecraft. Suddenly strange creatures seem to pop into existence around you. You manage to get to your feet and grab your rifle. You let out a burst of fire and smash the controls of the closes bulkhead door. You are locked in a small room in the aft of your ship. You check your vessel's computer system:

    Error: 404 Not Found

You craft's central server doesn't seem to be responding. You will need to make your way to the central cabin to restart the engine and make a SOS call. You realize that the ship is in lockdown and the only way to get to the bridge is to use the keycards to manually unlock the doors... if only you could remember where you put them.

### additional information

Grimdark is a 2D top down retro style tile based rouge-like shooter. Your goal is to fight through the mesterious green creatures on the ship to get to the ship's bridge. Along the way, you will have to find the keycards to unlock the next level. The key cards randomly drop off the monsters (there is a 1% drop rate) so get shooting and make sure to watch where your bullets go. Don't stand in one place for too long or the monsters will get you! As you progress through the game you will find that the monsters get faster and more numerous.
